# FaceDetection

 This library uses the latest [Ver-ID SDK](https://github.com/AppliedRecognition/Ver-ID-UI-Android) to detect a face in a supplied image and compare it to a face detected in a Ver-ID liveness detection session. The library communicates the similarity scores between the compared faces.
